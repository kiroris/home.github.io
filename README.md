## üîç Search Dialog
![image](assets/search-dialog.png)

The search dialog allows you to display a search bar with various search engines defined in the configuration. To select each one, you simply need to prefix the query with the corresponding `!<id>`.
By default, the defined search engines are:
- `!g`: google
- `!d`: duckduckgo
- `!y`: youtube
- `!r`: reddit
- `!p`: pinterest



## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Dialog
![config-dialog](assets/config-dialog.png)

The default configuration file is [userconfig.js](userconfig.js), but you can change it in the configuration dialog. You can find more information about how the file works in the [original repository](https://github.com/b-coimbra/dawn). The available components are tabs, a clock, and weather.

Additionally, there are two different new options:
- `fastlink`: To set the link of the Pokeball button.
- `localIcons`: To optimize the loading time of the icons, you can check it out [here](#local-icons).
